Angry.","scene_image_description":"A cartoony illustration in a dark, eerie horror atmosphere with ominous moonlit lighting of a small camping tent in a shadowy forest at night; a 23-year-old man with light skin, messy short brown hair, light stubble, wearing a dark hoodie, peeks out of the tent flap with terrified eyes; outside, partially hidden behind bushes, a tall humanoid silhouette with broad shoulders looms near the tent; the scene suggests tearing noises without showing gore, dark, eerie horror atmosphere with ominous moonlit lighting."},{"story_section":"It stopped the second I moved.
