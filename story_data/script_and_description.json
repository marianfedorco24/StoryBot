Or… the not sleeping thing. I’ll wake up at like 3 AM and she’s just sitting up in bed. Reading.

We hike in, the woods are alive—birds, crickets, everything. Then we reach the spot we pick to set up… and it all just stops. Like someone hit mute on nature.","scene_image_description":"A cartoony illustration in a dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting of a 21-year-old woman with light skin, long straight black hair, sharp cheekbones, wearing a dark flannel shirt, black jeans, and muddy boots, standing calmly beside a half-pitched tent in a forest clearing; a 23-year-old man with light skin, short messy brown hair, faint stubble, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans, looks around nervously; the trees loom tall, the air looks still, and the clearing feels unnaturally silent, dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting."},{"story_section":"I go, “Got real quiet suddenly, didn’t it?” And she doesn’t even smile.

I woke up in the tent… and she was gone. I unzipped the flap a little and listened. And I heard breathing right outside. Then this deep crunching sound—like something being torn apart. And her grunts… they were lower. Angry. Not… human.","scene_image_description":"A cartoony illustration in a dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting of a forest campsite at night with a small tent in the foreground; a 23-year-old man with light skin, short messy brown hair, faint stubble, wearing a gray t-shirt, peeks out from a partially opened tent flap with terrified eyes; outside the tent, a shadowy figure shaped like a 21-year-old woman with long black hair and a broad, tense posture crouches near something unseen, with implied torn debris and claw-like shadows, dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting."},{"story_section":"Then it stopped. Like she heard me. I dove back into my sleeping bag and pretended I was asleep.

Like, right by my ear. Her breathing was steady. But her body felt different—usually she’s soft, warm. This time she felt taut. Hard. Like muscle over wire.","scene_image_description":"A cartoony illustration in a dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting of a 21-year-old woman with light skin, long straight black hair, sharp cheekbones, wearing a dark flannel shirt, pressed close behind a 23-year-old man with light skin, short messy brown hair, faint stubble, wearing a gray t-shirt in a sleeping bag; the woman’s posture looks rigid and predatory, the man’s face is tense with fear; the tent interior is claustrophobic with sharp shadows, dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting."},{"story_section":"That was weeks ago. Now I catch her smiling at me and it doesn’t feel cute anymore. It feels like she’s deciding something. I’ll update if I find out what she really is… if I get the chance.","scene_image_description":"A cartoony illustration in a dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting of a 21-year-old woman with light skin, long straight black hair, sharp cheekbones, wearing a fitted dark flannel shirt and black jeans, smiling slightly with unsettling calm while standing in a dim apartment hallway; in the foreground, a 23-year-old man with light skin, short messy brown hair, faint stubble, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans, looks back at her with dread; the hallway is dark with a single flickering light, dark, ominous horror atmosphere with eerie moonlit lighting."}]}
